# Alt-coins-transfer
A simple program which lets you send you coins to the person you want to send to 


In this program I have used hashing, json structure - for the data validation

When ever we speak about nodes, we understand the data structure linked list, similarly in this program I have created the parent node which stores the address and is assigned with a hash value, later when there is a new block created for the same, the next hash value is chained to the previous hash value.
